SDLC MODELS: 
->Water Fall Model - not in use by IT industry
-> Prototype model - Protype is nothing but taking sample wether it is web page or project or demo 
->Incremental Model - Coming soon in somw websites thats what really it called ww generally or continuously update the Project

**Agile Model - is used to implement above SDLC model** Generally to set the drawback in Water Fall Model that is during Devlopment and testing there is no interaction with Client     
                                                        so we need to get client interaction we use this method.
