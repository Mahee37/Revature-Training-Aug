What are the 4 pillars of Agile?
As outlined in the Agile Manifesto, there are four main values of Agile project management:

Individuals over processes and tools: Agile teams value team collaboration and teamwork over working independently and doing things "by the book.‚Äù(Must Be TEAMWORKED)

Working software over comprehensive documentation: The software that Agile teams develop should work. Additional work, like documentation, is not as important as developing good software.(PREPARE PROPER DOCUMENTATION)

Customer collaboration over contract negotiation: Customers are extremely important within the Agile methodology. Agile teams allow customers to guide where the software should go. Therefore, customer collaboration is more important than the finer details of contract negotiation.(CILENT INTERACTION DURING THE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT)

Responding to change over following a plan: One of the major benefits of Agile project management is that it allows teams to be flexible. This framework allows for teams to quickly shift strategies and workflows without derailing an entire project.(PLAN CAN BE CHANGED DURING THE DVELOPMENT BASED UPON THE CUSTOMER /CLIENT ).
