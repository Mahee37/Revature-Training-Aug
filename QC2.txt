Week 2
Unit Testing :
		Testing is nothing but testing the code by passing the Prominent values to it,Generally Unit Testing is a open source testing framework for java
		progarmming and it is useful for to create the user own test cases and check the code performance.
		
//Manual Testing-Testing wich was not done by any Tool Support then it is called Manual Testing
//AutoMated Testing-Testing which was done by the Tool Support then it is called AutoMated Testing
//Unit Testing has many Annotation such as
//@Test-- It is used to Define method of Test Method
//@Test(timeout=1000) -- It is used to define the TesT Method Time frame if test method runs morethan 1000ms then the test case is failed
//@Before -- it tells that method can be invoked for the every test case
//@BeforeClass--It tell that method can be invoked only at the beginning of test cases
//@After--It tells that method can be invoked for the every test case
//AfterClass-it tells that method can be invoked only at the end of the test cases

Assert class:
//Generally Assert method is used to validate the conditions
//void assertEquals(object o1,object o2); --primitve or objects
//void assertTrue(boolean condition)
//void assertFalse(boolean condition)
//void assertNull(object obj1)
//void assertNotNull(object obj1)

File Handling:
	Handling the input and output Operations is known as file handling
	we can handle the file in two ways one is Read and Write 
	
//I/O reader--byte mode(InputStream) -- char mode(Reader) --writer--byte mode(OuputStream) --char mode(Writer)
//BufferReader(buffering characters from file means more chars from file) b = new BufferReader(new FileReader("my.txt"));
//BufferWriter(simillar to Reader)



Serialization :
	Converting byte Stream to object is serialization and object --> byte stream Deserialization
//ObjectOuptutStream.writeObject();
//ObjectInputStream.readObject();


Logger and Logging File:
         Logback is a framework to create and manage the highly configurable solution and genertaing the log files for java applications
//Generally Logback is a Succesor for Log4j Framework beacuse of its ease to use it was mostly used now
//log-Levels are: TRACE,DEBUG,INFO,WARN,ERROR-
//Trace- to find the all records of deatiled debugginf information
//Debug-it is also same asa trace but it is used to find precisded Debug Infomation
//INFo-Used to describe the applications normal messages
//Warn -it is used to describe the Potential Issues
//ERROR -it is used to describe the error Messages or to describe the errror


Factory Mode of Creating object:
	For the Code Safety creating a Object in Some Other class by using refernce of the object is known as FactoryMode Of Object Creation
//It is not safe to create the object direct for that we create a class for to create an object and we define a method in one class and implement the method in 
//another class then we will validate the input as "user"(opitonal) then we will create an object there
