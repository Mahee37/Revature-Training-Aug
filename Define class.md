is it possible to define class as PRIVATE ,PROTECTED AND STATIC?
we can create interface insidea Class
what if someone forces to create it as above
#java
class A
{
int i= 6;
  void add()
  {
  }
    class B //Inner class //member of class A
    {
      public static void main(string args[])
      {
      System.out.prinltn(i);
      }
      
    }
}
Inner Class can be Private Protected and Static.
